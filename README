Synthetic US 82,000-bus power system model.

This is an entirely synthetic 82,000 bus case, geographically covering
the continental US. It was created by combining case_ACTIVSg70k (eastern
US), case_ACTIVSg10k (western US) and case_ACTIVSg2k (Texas), connecting
the 3 interconnections with nine DC lines. The load in the network
roughly mimics the actual population of its geographic footprint. The
synthetic transmission system was designed by algorithms described in
[1] to be statistically similar to actual transmission system models
but without modeling any actual lines.

This is a synthetic power system model that does not represent the
actual grid. It was developed as part of the US ARPA-E GRID DATA
research project and contains no CEII.
